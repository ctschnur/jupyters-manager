* Some functionality to manage jupyter sessions from within emacs
E.g.: 
- open ~.ipynb~ files (to the browser) from dired ~cs-open-file-with-new-server~, ~cs-open-file-with-running-server~ (showing a list of already running servers)
- shutting down servers ~cs-shutdown-these-servers~ from a ~helm~ context menu
