* Some functionality to manage jupyter sessions from within emacs
E.g.: 
- open ~.ipynb~ files (to the browser) from dired ~jm-open-file-with-new-server~, ~jm-open-file-with-running-server~ (showing a list of already running servers)
- shutting down servers ~jm-shutdown-these-servers~ from a ~helm~ context menu

* todo list: 
- write function to open a temporary juypter notebook file with all autoload functionality initialized (i.e. `%load_ext autoload` and `%autoload 2`)
